### Creating a Strong Password

Your password is your first line of defense. Follow these guidelines:

- Use at least 8 characters
- Include uppercase and lowercase letters
- Include numbers and special characters
- Avoid common words or phrases
- Don't use personal information (birthday, name, etc.)
- Use a unique password for each account

### Password Best Practices

1. **Never share your password** with anyone
2. **Don't write it down** where others can find it
3. **Change it regularly** (every 3-6 months)
4. **Use a password manager** to generate and store strong passwords
5. **Enable two-factor authentication** for extra security
