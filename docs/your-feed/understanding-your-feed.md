### What is Your Feed?

Your feed is the main page where you see posts from friends, pages you follow, and suggested content. It's personalized based on your interests and interactions.

### Feed Algorithm

The feed algorithm determines what content you see and in what order. It considers:
- Your interactions with posts (likes, comments, shares)
- Your relationships with other users
- The type of content you engage with most
- Recent activity and trending topics
